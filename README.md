## Real Estate Services and Smart Estimation System

## Project Overview
Mi'mar is a digital platform developed to organize and improve the real estate services sector by connecting service providers with clients inside a structured and supervised environment.  
The project aims to replace traditional and unorganized communication methods with a reliable system that supports account verification, business account approval, service review, order management, ratings, favorites, reports, notifications, and direct communication between users and service providers. The system description and functional requirements also specify these core workflows, including business account review, service approval, browsing and filtering, ordering, ratings, favorites, reports, and administrative control. fileciteturn0file0L1-L17 fileciteturn0file0L56-L71

In addition to the core marketplace functions, the project includes an advanced proposed feature: a **quantity and cost estimation module** for small construction and finishing projects. This feature transforms the platform from a digital marketplace into a decision-support tool that helps users estimate materials, costs, and related services before التنفيذ. The uploaded project document describes this as a key practical enhancement to support planning and reduce randomness in cost estimation. fileciteturn0file0L1-L17

## Problem Statement
The real estate services field often depends on direct personal communication and informal coordination, which leads to:
- Difficulty finding suitable service providers
- Weak organization of requests and offers
- Limited transparency and trust
- No structured review or approval process
- No reliable method for ratings, reporting, and service quality control

Mi'mar addresses these issues through a managed platform with role-based administration and clear workflows for users, business accounts, and services. fileciteturn0file0L1-L17

## Objectives
The main objectives of the project are:
- Build a trusted digital environment for real estate services
- Allow users to create and manage business accounts
- Allow service providers to publish services after approval
- Enable clients to browse, filter, request, rate, and favorite services
- Provide administrators with complete control over categories, cities, reports, business accounts, and services
- Add a smart estimation module for quantities and costs in small construction projects

## System Components
The platform consists of three main parts:
1. **Mobile / API side for users**
2. **Administrative dashboard**
3. **Backend system** for business logic, permissions, validation, review, and workflow control

The project document explicitly describes the platform as a complete system composed of a user application, an admin dashboard, and a backend responsible for operations, verification, and permissions. fileciteturn0file0L1-L17

## Proposed Feature: Quantity and Cost Estimation Module
### Academic Description
To enhance the platform and move beyond its role as only a marketplace for real estate services, a smart module was proposed to support users during the pre-execution phase of small construction projects. This module helps users estimate project quantities and approximate costs before requesting services.

### Purpose
The module transforms the platform into a **Decision Support System** by allowing users to:
- Estimate quantities of required materials
- Approximate project costs
- Improve planning before execution
- Connect estimation results with service providers already available inside the platform

### Inputs
The user can provide:
- Work type
- Length
- Width
- Height when needed
- City

### Outputs
The system can calculate:
- Area or volume
- Estimated material quantities
- Estimated project cost
- Matching available services or providers

### Technical Value
This feature relies on:
- Mathematical formulas
- City-based material pricing
- Database queries
- Organized business logic

It does not require complex artificial intelligence, but it provides strong practical value and future scalability.
